/**
 * Plan for implementing "Notify Me" notification when item is sold:
 * 
 * 1. In public/Detailed_post.html:
 *    - The "Notify Me" button already inserts a 'cart' transaction for the user.
 *    - Add a real-time subscription or polling to detect when the item status changes to "sold".
 *    - When the item status changes to "sold", check if the logged-in user has a 'cart' transaction for this item.
 *    - If yes, send a notification to the user (insert into notifications table) with type 'item_sold'.
 *    - Optionally, update the UI to inform the user that the item has been sold.
 * 
 * 2. In public/notification.html:
 *    - The page already fetches and displays notifications including those of type 'item_sold'.
 *    - No changes needed here unless UI improvements are desired.
 * 
 * 3. Backend considerations (if applicable):
 *    - Ideally, the notification insertion should be done server-side or via a database trigger when item status changes.
 *    - If backend code is accessible, implement a trigger or API endpoint to handle this.
 * 
 * 4. Implementation steps:
 *    - Modify Detailed_post.html's real-time subscription callback to detect item status change to "sold".
 *    - On detection, query transactions table for users with 'cart' status for this item.
 *    - For each such user, insert a notification of type 'item_sold'.
 *    - Notify the user in the UI if they are currently viewing the page.
 * 
 * 5. Edge cases:
 *    - Ensure the buyer of the reserved item does not get the notification.
 *    - Handle cases where user is not logged in.
 * 
 * This plan assumes the use of Supabase client in the frontend and the existing database schema.
